This project is intended to to read a txt file containing a list of different vegetables, and then store and display the amounts of each item. It accurately sorted through the different vegetables and kept track of the quantities. It then prints out the amounts of all, certain vegetables, and displays all as a histogram. The project is effective and not overly complicated, its simplicity allows for further improvement and advancement for the future. The project could be improved upon on the input validation aspect. It validates the user input for menu options, but that is the extent of the input validation. The most difficulty that I had with this project was the methods to open, close, and store data onto files. I was puzzled in the beginning, but after studying on the matter I believe they will be a good skillset to have. The file controls, as well as the switches are methods that I believe are helpful and useful for future projects. The simplicity of this program is what has made it readable and maintainable. It is compact and the individual sections of the program are easily indentifiable. Any new functions needed can be added onto the menu function via the switch.
